## What You Can Customize

1. **Cursor Size and Shape**  
- Width, height, border, border-radius, and transition control the cursor appearance.  
- Example: `width:20px; height:20px; border:2px solid #3b82f6; border-radius:50%;`

2. **Body Styles**  
- Adjust background color, font, and text color to match your website.  
- Example: `body { cursor:none; background:#111; color:#fff; }`

3. **Cursor Movement**  
- JavaScript listens to `mousemove` events to update the cursor position.  
- You can add hover effects or animations within the mousemove listener.

4. **Additional Customization Ideas**  
- Change cursor color or size when hovering over links or buttons.  
- Add glow, shadows, or scale effects for more interactivity.  
- Use different shapes dynamically for different sections of your website.
