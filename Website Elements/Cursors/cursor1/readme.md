## What You Can Change

1. Cursor Size and Shape  
- CSS rules controlling `.cursor`: width, height, border, border-radius, and transition.  
- `width` & `height` → Change the size of the cursor  
- `border` → Change the color to match your theme  
- `border-radius` → 50% for circle; 0% for square  
- `transition` → Adjust speed of cursor movement

2. Body Styles  
- CSS rules controlling `body`: cursor, font-family, background, color, display, justify-content, align-items  
- `background` → Change page background color  
- `font-family` → Adjust font style  
- `color` → Change page text color

3. Cursor Movement Script  
- JavaScript listens to `mousemove` and updates the `.cursor` position to follow the mouse  
- You can add hover effects or animations inside this listener

4. Additional Ideas  
- Change cursor color or size on hover over links or buttons  
- Add glow, shadows, or scale effects for interactivity  
- Use different shapes dynamically for different sections
