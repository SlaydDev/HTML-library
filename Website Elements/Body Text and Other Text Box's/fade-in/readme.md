## What You Can Change

1. Paragraph Text  
- Replace the placeholder text `[PARAGRAPH_1]`, `[PARAGRAPH_2]`, `[PARAGRAPH_3]` with your own content.  
- You can add more `<p>` elements; remember to add appropriate animation delays in CSS.

2. Animation Timing  
- The CSS `animation-delay` values control when each paragraph fades in.  
- The `fadeIn` animation duration can be adjusted to make text appear faster or slower.

3. Text Styling  
- CSS rules for `p` control font-family, font-size, line-height, color, and margin.  
- You can customize these to match your website design.
