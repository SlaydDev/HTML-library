## üé® What You Can Change

### 1. Colors (line ~25)
Edit the CSS variables to match your theme:

:root {
  --ball:#3b82f6;   /* Main ball color */
  --rim:#93c5fd;    /* Text outline color */

  --accent:#8b5cf6; /* Accent gradient color */
}

### 2. Title Text (line ~157)
Update the text that appears after loading:

<div class="title">YOUR_TEXT_HERE</div>

Replace `YOUR_TEXT_HERE` with your own message.

### 3. Matrix Characters & Density (JavaScript section)
Modify which characters fall and how many lines appear:

const characters = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789'; // characters used
const numberOfDrops = 100; // number of rain lines

- Change `characters` to add symbols or letters.
- Adjust `numberOfDrops` for more or less rain.

Fine-tune how fast things happen:
- **Loading bar:** `@keyframes loadingFill` (`4s`)
- **Typing effect:** `@keyframes typing` (`4s`)
- **Ball fall:** `@keyframes fall` (`1.2s`)
